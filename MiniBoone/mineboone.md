# MiniBoone

This project was created for a meeting of the TRIUMF Data Science group.
It is a simple introduction to using PyTorch to produce neural networks. 
It uses the dataset readily available at the 
[UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/MiniBooNE+particle+identification). 
This data attempts to identify 'signals' (neutrino events) within a background of other physical processes. 

## Goals of the Project:

1. Visualize the dataset.

2. Produce and train neural networks in PyTorch. 

3. Assess the accuracy.

4. Beat the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0508045) that was written about this data!

## Project Requirements:

Standard Tools: `numpy` `pandas`

Visualization Tools: `matplotlib` `seaborn`

Data Analysis Tools: `scikit-learn` `pytorch` `numpy`
