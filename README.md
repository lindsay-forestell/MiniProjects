# MiniProjects
Short data science projects to become familiar with various tools.

[MiniBoone](MiniBoone)

* This project looks at the MiniBoone dataset which attempts to identify signals vs background in a neutrino detector experiment. 

* The project uses PyTorch to build simple neural networks and build up an understanding of how these are implemented. 

* Some standard visualizations are included as well.
